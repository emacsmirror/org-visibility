* Org Visibility

Org Visibility is an Emacs package that adds the ability to persist (save and
load) the state of the visible sections of =org-mode= files.  The state is
automatically saved when the file is saved or killed, and restored when the
file is loaded.

See the [[file:org-visibility.el::;;; Installation][Installation]] and [[file:org-visibility.el::;;; Usage][Usage]] sections in the [[file:org-visibility.el][source code]] for more
information.

Unit tests can be run by [[file:org-visibility-test.el][loading the test file]] and calling =eval-buffer=.
