  Org Visibility is an Emacs package that adds the ability to persist (save and
  load) the state of the visible sections of =org-mode= files.  The state is
  automatically saved when the file is saved or killed, and restored when the
  file is loaded.

  See the =Installation= and =Usage= parts of the =Commentary= section in
  [[file:org-visibility.el][org-visibility.el]] for more information.

  Emacs version 27.1 or later is required.

  Build with =make=.

  Clean with =make clean=.

  Run tests with =make test=.

  All files are generated from [[file:org-visibility.org][org-visibility.org]] using Emacs' org-mode literate
  programming system to "tangle" them.
