load) the state of the visible sections of =org-mode= files.  The state is
automatically saved when the file is saved or killed, and restored when the
file is loaded.

Emacs version 27.1 or later is required.

See the [[file:org-visibility.el::;; Installation][Installation]] and [[file:org-visibility.el::;; Usage][Usage]] sections in the [[file:org-visibility.el][source code]] for more
information.
