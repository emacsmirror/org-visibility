* Org Visibility

Org Visibility is an Emacs package that adds the ability to persist (save and
load) the state of the visible sections of =org-mode= files.  The state is
automatically saved when the file is saved or killed, and restored when the
file is loaded.

See the =Installation= and =Usage= parts of the =Commentary= section in
[[file:org-visibility.el][org-visibility.el]] for more information.

Emacs version 27.1 or later is required.

Build with =make=.

Clean with =make clean=.

Run tests with =make test=.
